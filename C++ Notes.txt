C++ Notes

& address of operator
Use & operator to pass by reference instead of value in functions
Pass by reference is generally preferable

* dereference-operator

An array variable itself is just a memory address

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable

nullptr keyword represents a null pointer literal

You should set undeclared pointers to null

Use const keyword to make variables read only. Conveys intent. Can be used for function parameters. 

new keyword operator allows you to allocate memory in the heap instead of stack

use delete operator to delete pointers once memory is no longer in use. Use delete[] when deleting an array.

Use struct keyword to make structures that group related variables. Access members of a struct using a . operator.

Use enums to declare paired name-integer constants

When making classes use public: header to make attributes and methods public. Use private header to abstract information users don't need.
this-> keyword is like self.
