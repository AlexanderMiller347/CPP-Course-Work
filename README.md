# C++ Course Work
This repository contains a collection of small C++ programs created to practice core programming concepts during my early Computer Science coursework. These projects demonstrate foundational skills including control structures, loops, functions, conditionals, user input, and basic algorithm implementation.

## Contents

### `Credit Card Number Validation`
Implements the Luhn Algorithm to validate credit card numbers entered by the user. Focuses on digit manipulation, input validation, and modular arithmetic.

### `Number Guessing Game`
A console-based guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number. Reinforces use of loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

### `Quiz Game`
Simple text-based quiz application that asks multiple-choice questions and tracks the score. Uses conditional logic, user input, and basic game loop structure.

### `Rectangle Loop Test`
Generates a rectangle of characters based on user input. Focuses on nested loops and simple pattern printing.

### `Simple Bubble Sort`
Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers entered by the user. Demonstrates fundamental sorting logic and array manipulation.

### `Tic Tac Toe`
A player vs. CPU console-based version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Includes a game loop, win condition checks, and a simple board display system using arrays.

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Library
- Visual Studio / VS Code

## Purpose

These programs were built as practice for learning the basics of procedural programming and algorithm design in C++. They serve as a portfolio of beginner-level C++ work and demonstrate problem-solving, control flow, and early software structure.
